# Bernie's Bistro
Forked from Dev Bootcamp.
Completed March 15, 2017.
Challenge limited to hour and a half to complete.


## Summary
I built "Bernie's" restaurant's recipe system.

### Recipe System Use Cases
![required use cases](readme-assets/required-animation.gif)
*Figure 1*. Example usage, listing all recipes and displaying a specific recipe.

The recipe system should support two uses:  (1) users should be able to list all the recipes in the system and (2) users should be able to display the details for a specific recipe.  Figure 1 displays both of these uses and how Bernie would like to run the application.
